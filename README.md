An Proof-of-Concept demo to showcase new technologies to build Restful API's in no-time at all. Built a NestJS project, configuring Docker to containerize PostgreSQL and Prisma to model the database schema and to easily interface with the database. Add CRUD operations using NestJS CLI boilerplate templates and documented the APIs in Swagger
